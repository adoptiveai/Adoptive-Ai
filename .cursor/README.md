# Cursor Configuration

This directory contains guidance for using Cursor's AI features within the Adoptive AI frontend repository.

- `rules`: High-level conventions Cursor should follow when assisting with code changes.
- Update the rules whenever project conventions change (new testing patterns, new directory layout, etc.).
- Keep this folder committed so team members get consistent AI behaviour.
